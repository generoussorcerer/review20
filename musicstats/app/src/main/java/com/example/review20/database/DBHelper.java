                "Canadian rapper and vocalist Drake sustained a high-level commercial presence shortly after he hit the scene in 2006, whether with his own chart-topping releases or a long string of guest appearances on hits by the likes of Lil Wayne, Rihanna, and A$AP Rocky. Thanks to his introspective rap style, his sensitive R&B crooning, and his gold-touch songwriting, each one of his albums -- from 2011's Take Care to 2018's Scorpion -- topped charts worldwide, and singles like the Grammy-winning \"Hotline Bling\" and many of his mixtapes did too. As his star rose, he helped others along, sponsoring The Weeknd's early work, starting the OVO Sound label, and giving features on his records to up-and-coming acts. By the second decade of his career, Drake's constant chart domination, his Grammy wins and nominations, and his meme-worthy cultural presence made him one of the world's most popular musicians.",

He has been referred to as the \"Prince of Reggaeton\" (from Spanish: \"Príncipe del Reggaetón\"), and is one of the best-selling Latin music artists with sales of more than 35 million records (albums and singles) worldwide. Balvin was born in Medellín, Colombia. At age 17, he moved to the United States to learn English, where he lived in both Oklahoma and New York. He then returned to Medellín and gained popularity performing at clubs in the city.",
                "Juice WRLD became a Top Ten hitmaker delivering introspective lyrics atop melodic production, with echoes of Travis Scott and Post Malone. His heartsick 2018 debut Goodbye & Good Riddance (2018), home to his biggest hit \"Lucid Dreams,\" reflected a wide range of stylistic influences: R&B instrumentation, dreamy beats, and even indie rock melodicism. The momentum built by \"Lucid Dreams\" helped land Juice's sophomore effort A Death Race for Love (2019) at the top of the charts. Months later, at the height of his mainstream popularity, he tragically passed away after suffering a medical emergency at Chicago's Midway Airport; he had just turned 21. At the time of his death, Juice had three singles in the Hot 100 and both official LPs in the Top 100.",
                "Enigmatic masked DJ/producer Marshmello makes groove-oriented, synth- and bass-heavy electronic dance music that found mainstream crossover success in the late 2010s. In the spirit of similarly cloaked dance figures like deadmau5 and Daft Punk, Marshmello performs wearing a full-head-covering, in his case a marshmallow mask. Despite his early anonymity, Marshmello's career blew up in 2015 when he began releasing tracks online. From there came shows at New York's Pier 94, Pomona, California's HARD Day of the Dead festival, and Miami Music Week. He also scored a number five Billboard electronic/dance album with his full-length debut, Joytime. Collaborative hits followed, with artists including  Selena Gomez(\"Wolves\"),  Khalid(\"Silence\"), and  Bastille(the platinum hit \"Happier\"). He hit a personal chart peak in 2019 with his revolutionary in-game concert Fortnite Extended Set.",
                "The Weeknd took over pop music & culture on his own terms filtering R&B, Pop,& hip-hop through an ambitious widescreen lens. The multi-platinum 3X GRAMMY Award winner has emerged as one of the most successful & significant artists of the modern era. 2012’s 3X platinum \"Trilogy\" collated 3 breakout mixtapes—House of Balloons, Thursday & Echoes of Silence—into his 1st chart-topping collection followed by his debut LP \"Kiss Land\" in 2013. Two years later, “Earned It (Fifty Shades of Grey)” won “Best R&B Performance” & received an Academy Award nod for “Best Original Song” & 4X Platinum \"Beauty Behind The Madness\" won a GRAMMY for “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” In 2018, \"Starboy\" won the same award, making him the 1st artist ever to win twice. His 6-track project My Dear Melancholy marked his 3rd consecutive #1 bow on the Billboard Top 200, & “Pray For Me” with Kendrick Lamar was featured in the trailer for the Academy Award winning Marvel film Black Panther. In 2020 the 80’s-nostalgic track \"Blinding Lights\" became a worldwide sensation, igniting viral dance challenges across social media, peaking at #1 in 30+ countries & headlining Mercedes Benz EQC campaign.",
                "Record-breaking South Korean boy band BTS (aka Bangtan Boys) deliver an energetic blend of dance-pop and hip-hop with deeply introspective lyrics that helped them build a devoted global following while also making them one of the most successful Korean exports in the world. Debuting in the early 2010s with their Skool trilogy, they steadily expanded their audience until breaking into the mainstream consciousness with the Love Yourself series. After the platinum-certified Love Yourself: Tear became their first number one effort outside of their home country, the compilation Love Yourself: Answer found them topping charts in Canada and Japan. By 2020, international fervor reached a peak with their fourth release Map of the Soul: 7, which topped the charts in over 20 countries. Hitting another milestone that summer, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to top the U.S. singles chart with their retro-disco track \"Dynamite\" from their chart-topping fifth set, Be.",

                "Taylor Swift is that rarest of pop phenomena: a superstar who managed to completely cross over from country to the mainstream. Others have performed similar moves -- notably, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson both became enduring pop-culture icons based on their '70s work -- but Swift shed her country roots like they were a second skin; it was a necessary molting to reveal she was perhaps the sharpest, savviest populist singer/songwriter of her generation, one who could harness the zeitgeist, make it personal and, just as impressively, perform the reverse. These skills were evident on her earliest hits, especially the neo-tribute \"Tim McGraw,\" but her second album, 2008's Fearless, showcased a songwriter discovering who she was and, in the process, finding a mass audience. Fearless wound up having considerable legs not only in the U.S., where it racked up six platinum singles on the strength of the Top Ten hits \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me,\" but throughout the world, performing particularly well in the U.K., Canada, and Australia.",
                "Within five years of his debut, American rapper and singer/songwriter Post Malone went from genre novelty to certified superstar, amassing a string of Top Ten singles with a hybrid style that joined his unique vocal delivery, pained lyrics, and hip-hop production inspired as much by Tim McGraw as Kanye West. After the release of his 2015 quintuple-platinum single \"White Iverson\" off debut Stoney, he quickly ascended to the top of the pop mainstream in the late 2010s with a succession of multi-platinum hits that included chart-toppers \"Rockstar\" with 21 Savage and \"Psycho\" with Ty Dolla $ign from 2018's number one, Grammy-nominated album Beerbongs & Bentleys and the Grammy-nominated \"Sunflower\" with Swae Lee from 2019's Hollywood's Bleeding.",
                "A Houston-born hip-hop artist and producer affiliated with Kanye West's \"GOOD Music\" and T.I.'s \"Grand Hustle\", Travis Scott became known during the early 2010s for his heavily Auto-Tuned half-sung/half-rapped vocal style. Within seven years of his mainstream arrival via Kanye West's Cruel Summer compilation (2012), on which he served as co-producer and featured artist, Scott attained numerous platinum singles as a lead artist, including a streak of four that began with \"Antidote,\" a track off his number three hit debut album, Rodeo (2015). He followed with a pair of number one full-lengths, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight (2016) and Astroworld (2018), all the while assisting in platinum singles headlined by the likes of  Rihanna(\"Bitch Better Have My Money\"),  SZA(\"Love Galore\"), and  Drake(\"Portland\"), and working extensively with Quavo as Huncho Jack. Whether leading or supporting, Scott's presence was unmistakable, almost always colored with an array of ad-lib trills including but not limited to \"It's lit,\" \"Yeah, yeah,\" and \"Straight up.\"",
                "Ariana Grande is perhaps the quintessential pop star of the last half of the 2010s, capturing the era's spirit and style. Emerging in 2013 with the hit single \"The Way,\" Grande initially appeared to be the heir to the throne of Mariah Carey, due in part to her powerhouse vocals. With its Babyface production, her debut Yours Truly underscored her debt to '90s R&B, but Grande quickly incorporated hip-hop and EDM into her music. \"Problem,\" a 2014 smash duet with Iggy Azalea, was the first indication of her development, an evolution underscored by the hits \"Bang Bang\" and \"Love Me Harder,\" which featured Jessie J & Nicki Minaj and The Weeknd, respectively. Grande maintained her popularity with 2016's Dangerous Woman, then really hit her stride with 2018's Sweetener and its swift sequel Thank U, Next, whose title track became her first number one pop hit. That achievement was quickly equaled by \"7 Rings,\" a glitzy anthem for the Instagram age that consolidated her stardom and artistry, as well as \"Positions,\" the lead single from 2020's R&B-heavy album of the same name.",
                "After closing out 2020 with three smash singles - “Holy,” with Chance The Rapper, “Lonely” with benny blanco, and “Monster” with Shawn Mendes – Justin Bieber reigns as one of the biggest artists in the word: the #1 artist on YouTube with 60mm subscribers, the #2 artist on Spotify global with over 65mm monthly listeners, over 200mm in combined U.S. radio audience per week, and three Grammy nominations and an American Music Award for his 2020 album Changes.",
                "Primarily known for being one-third of the hip-hop/trap collective Migos, Quavo (real name Quavious Marshall) is a rapper and hip-hop artist from Lawrenceville, Georgia. Alongside  Offset(his cousin) and Takeoff (his nephew), he helped form Migos in 2009 and they released their first mixtapes, Juug Season in 2011 and No Label in 2012. (No Label went on to receive a sequel in 2014.) However, it wasn't until the release of the track \"Versace\" from their 2013 mixtape, Young Rich N*ggas, that they came to full prominence. The song was a breakout hit, receiving further exposure when Drake produced a remix. In 2014, Quavo was named \"most influential rapper\" by the online hip-hop community Complex Music. In subsequent years, he appeared on further releases with Migos, most notably their full-length albums Yung Rich Nation (2015) and C U L T U R E (2017). ",
                "Eminem is one of the best-selling artists in music history, easily the biggest crossover success ever seen in rap. To call him hip-hop's Elvis Presley is correct to a degree, but it's largely inaccurate. Certainly, he was the first white rapper since Beastie Boys to garner both sales and critical respect, but his impact has exceeded this confining distinction. On sheer verbal skills, Eminem is one of the greatest MCs of his generation: rapid, fluid, dexterous, and unpredictable, capable of pulling off long-form narratives or withering asides. And thanks to his mentor Dr. Dre, he's had music to match: thick, muscular loops evoking the terror and paranoia conjured by Em's lyrics. To be certain, a great deal of the controversy Eminem courted -- during the turn of the millennium, there was no greater pop cultural bogeyman than Marshall Mathers -- came through in how his violent fantasias, often directed at his mother or his wife, intertwined with flights of absurdity that appealed to listeners too young to absorb the psychodramas Eminem explored on his hit albums, The Slim Shady LP and The Marshall Mathers LP.",
                "Emmanuel Gazmey Santiago, known professionally as Anuel AA, is a retired Puerto Rican rapper and singer. He is considered a pioneer of the Latin trap movement and his lyrics often discuss crime and urban life in Puerto Rico. His music often contains samples and interpolations of songs that were popular during his youth. He is seen as a controversial figure in the Latin music scene for his legal troubles and feuds with fellow Puerto Rican rappers Cosculluela and Ivy Queen and with the American rapper 6ix9ine.",
